# DigiRoyale Plans/Ideas

## New days go right here

Zach:  
An abstracted "simulation engine" that simulates a battle royale between a bunch of characters. Characters have stats/classes, traits (aggro, leader, evasive, etc.), inventories, locations, alliances, and injuries.
The map is divided into a grid and you can only fight someone in the same square, for instance. The map keeps track of changes such as traps set or buildings built.
There will be a whole bunch of events with conditions. I.e. if a player made a fire they might be ambushed if another player saw it.

This will then be used with the discord bot interface to fill in a game with server members and provide the little summary messages. If the engine generates time-stamped events the bot could relay them in real time (probably in its own channel) so we could follow along with what's happening. Then it will give a summary each day possibly with images of our avatars.  

We also talked about eventually having like a viewable map (maybe at certain intervals)

J:  
I like the idea of each character having at least one action per day but not only one necessarily. Like, maybe they all have one non-encounter related action per day and also encounters on top of that?

Pure Devin:  
I like the idea of having a personality system that can be used to base other actions. I.e. risk-taking vs risk-averse that could influence whether the player attempts to take supplies from the cornucopia or not, trusting vs distrusting that impacts forming and joining alliances, etc. Down the road of course.

J:  
Allowing players to create their stats to influence events could be cool though. Players will indirectly create their characters via a personality test

Pure Devin:  
Iâ€™d love to have more visible to us in general. See what players think about other players, view inventories, locations, alliances, really whatever features we end up expanding on.
